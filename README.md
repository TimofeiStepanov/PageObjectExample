# PageObjectExample
pytest - selenium - pageobject example


This project to be creating in the process of an independent study of the pytest framework, its capabilities in testing Web resources using Selenium and the PageObject pattern.

To my regret, I don't have a mentor and the examples found don't go beyond the primitive filling of the search bar with the statement "Today we will learn how to write pytest-selenium-pageobject autotests in 5 - 15 -30 minutes !!!" and contain low-quality code.

However, pytest and selenium have good documentation, which is what I focused on.

Probably strange things remotely similar to a bicycle will be invented here, but this is a learning process and this is inevitable when working on your own.
